# adventofesocode

hello! this is going to be where I put my answers for the annual Advent of Code events, specifically with ESOLANGS!

yeah that's about it...

# AoC 2023
I haven't done much with my esolang Trampoles, so why not dedicate an entire month to it?

# (SOON) AoC 2024
planning to do a random esolang each day

oh wow what a surprise!  I didn't do it! wow!
